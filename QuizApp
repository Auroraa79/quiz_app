# 🧠 Python Quiz App

This is a simple **console-based quiz app** built with Python.  
It demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as:

- Lists and dictionaries
- For loops and enumeration
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- User input and string manipulation
- Score tracking and feedback

## 🔹 How it works
The quiz presents a series of questions to the user.  
Each question is checked against the correct answer, and feedback is given immediately.  
The final score is shown at the end of the game.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required

## 📌 Why I built this
As part of my journey to learn Python and practice problem-solving, I built this app to strengthen my understanding of **control structures** and **user interaction**.

## 🚀 Future improvements
- Load questions from a file
- Add difficulty levels
- Save user scores
- Add a timer or limit attempts
